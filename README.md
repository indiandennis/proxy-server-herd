# Proxy Server Herd for Google Places API
This was created as the final project for CS131 - Programming Languages. The project isn't very realistic and implements things in a way that I would not in a personal project, but because it had to fit certain requirements, I was forced to implement it this way.

The goal was to design a server herd that can take requests from clients with various queries. The servers keep track of client locations and need to synchronize the information between the herd. The clients can also query the Google Place's API, which the herd needs to proxy. Overall, this project is more about learning about asynchronicity and Python than about solving any particular problem.

Please see the formal writeup for greater detail.
